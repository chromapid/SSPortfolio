        <h2>Monocle rendering engine</h2>
        <p>Monocle is a rendering program I wrote using C++ and OpenGL.</p>
        <p>You may try it out on a Windows computer using this link, if you would like.
            To do so, extract the bin.zip folder and run "test.exe" for a demonstration.</p>
        <p>
            To adjust your camera position and angle, use your mouse and WASD keys. Press ALT-F4 to close the program.
        </p>
